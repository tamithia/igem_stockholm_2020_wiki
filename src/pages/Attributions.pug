        # Overview
        All work included in this project, unless otherwise specified, has been carried out, analyzed and reported by the iGEM Stockholm 2020 team. However, despite all our evident work and effort, these achievements could not have been possible without the support of all our supervisors, instructors, and advisors. Therefore, we want to deeply thank them for all their support and guidance on this page. Each of them has contributed to different chapters of our whole story, we hope you have enjoyed it as we did.
