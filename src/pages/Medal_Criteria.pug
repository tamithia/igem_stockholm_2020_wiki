                  [Collaborations](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Collaborations) were a very important aspect of our team this year. We tried to connect with as many teams as we can, to fill the gap of physical distance.

                  [Integrated Human Practices](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Human_Practices) made our project even more interesting and applicable to the real world.
                  
                  [Project Modeling](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Model) helped us to gain some insight on how our system could be improved and how it would work when finished.

                  [Science Communication](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Education). Our project "Lab on Screens" was a great way to reach people all over the world and communicate science in a fun and educative way.
                  
                  [Excellence in Another Area](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Education#toxinOFFgame). This year we also developed an online game "toxinOFF" to keep company to the people that were staying at home.
