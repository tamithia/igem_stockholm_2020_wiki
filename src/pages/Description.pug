        For all life on our planet, water is essential. Without clean water sources, the entire ecosystem suffers. With more pollutants accumulating every day, the problem only grows with no solution in sight. Our oceans are vast, but some of them, like the Baltic Sea, are more sensitive [Karin Wiberg et. al, 2013](#citation1). It is almost completely landlocked and is therefore exposed to more sources of pollution, leading to a higher pollutant concentration. This problem arises from lower water circulation compared to other bodies of water with better contact to the Atlantic ocean [Bergknut et. al, 2011](#citation2). The Baltic ecosystem also has fewer functional groups and fewer species within each group, making it less resilient than ecosystems with higher biodiversity [The BaltSens project, n.d.](#citation3).

        Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of especially problematic pollutants that are not readily degraded in the environment. POPs can biomagnify in aquatic and marine food chains [Jones and de Voogt, 1999; Mackay and Fraser, 2000](#citation4). They include a large variety of pollutants, including halogenated legacy chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chemicals with emerging concern e.g. perfluorinated compounds (PFOS). Chemicals such as PCBs and PFOS are lipophilic or proteophilic and can be found in relatively high concentrations within aquatic organisms [Schmidt, 1999](#citation6). Even if the pollution would remain localized, POPs can be absorbed in plastics (e.g. microplastics) that are then carried via marine organisms that ingest them, as well as ocean currents transporting the pollution worldwide [Rios et al., 2007](#citation7). POPs have been found as far as the Arctic and subarctic ecosystems, likely from migrating biota like birds or fish [Evenset et al., 2007](#citation8).

        Monitoring water pollution data is key to effectively deal with pollution. This includes good measurement methods and accurate reporting. Different controls and regulations for different regions complicates the data collection, prompting the development of reporting agreements like HELCOM [Stockholm International Water Institute, n.d.](#citation9). But the current methods of measurement, which is to take water samples and analyze them in the lab, are not good enough to reach the environmental goals. Water samples have a lot of innate sources of errors. To get accurate data a large number of samples need to be taken continually, and with the massive flows in water treatment plants it is especially hard to get good representative results [Merit Laboratories, Inc., 2020](#citation10). Water sample analytics methods also include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is a very accurate method but remains an expensive piece of lab equipment. By lowering the cost of monitoring, the accessibility will increase, allowing more countries to monitor their water [US EPA, n.d.](#citation11).

        Our aim is to create a monitor that can fill this gap in pollution detection. It will contain two major parts, an *Escherichia coli* module for detection of pollutants and a Shewanella oneidensis module producing an electrical output thanks to a Microbial fuel cell (MFC). The MFC contains a *Shewanella oneidensis* biofilm with metal reducing capabilities. The *E. coli* biosensor detection module  utilizes promoters that upregulate a series of genes upon detection of specific polluting compounds. When these genes are activated they express quorum sensing (QS) molecules that can be received by the electrical output module. *S. oneidensis* contains an oscillatory circuit. Depending on the specific QS-molecule produced by the biosensor, a different period in the oscillatory signal can be observed, thus enabling the detection and identification of a pollutant present in a water sample.
