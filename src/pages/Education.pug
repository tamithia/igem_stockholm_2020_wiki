    :markdown-it(html)

        In the face of a global pandemic and daily media articles sprouting with scientific jargon, the importance of conveying science in a coherent and accessible manner has perhaps been more important than ever.
        
        Our public engagement and education journey was heavily tinted by this responsibility. Whilst we were grateful for having an engaged society we wanted to ensure we could provide simple yet informative scientific content especially as a platform for introducing synthetic biology. We focused on accessibility, simplicity and encouraging scientific curiosity. This greatly shaped how we chose to interact and engage with the public. Moreover, with multiple creative talents within our team we wanted to harness our skill set to convey synthetic biology in a fun and artistic way. After all, the greatest scientific discoveries are often found at the junction between science and creativity.  
        
        It all boiled down to a set of concrete projects, tackling different aspects of our focus areas. We chose to spend time on developing these ideas and build upon our projects in a manner that they could be built upon by future teams designing them to stand the test of time. 
        **Without further ado, let us present our public engagement and education journey.**
        
        # Lab on Screens
        How does one best showcase synthetic biology in an easy and accessible manner during a global pandemic? The digital platform seemed like a natural choice and we were excited by the prospect of having the whole world as our stage. Yet we were certain we didnâ€™t want this to be a one sided performance, it was equally if not more important to allow for our audience to engage with us and each other. The best way to **understand** synthetic biology is to **do** synthetic biology.
        And thus the idea for a series of do-it-yourself home experiments was born.
        Pertaining to **accessibility.** we wanted to ensure that the experiments only involved ingredients easily accessible in the supermarket, not requiring an extra trip outside of the house in pandemic times. Safety measurements were also detailed and recommended in the beginning of each episode. **Simplicity** to the **scientific** background was ensured by depicting the concepts by a series of descriptive cartoon-styled animations backed with easy to understand voice overs explaining the scientific concepts. Scientific curiosity was developed by encouraging audience questioning and by providing a platform where seemingly complex scientific techniques such as DNA extraction or cell cultivation was carried out by the audience themselves. The message was: "Synthetic biology can be easy and fun".
        ##  Episode 1
        The start of our journey. We chose to focus on an easy and visual topic, using red cabbage as a pH indicator. We took this a step further and encouraged our participants to measure the pH of their tap water, relating to our project about water quality. Most importantly, we wanted maximum audience interaction and set up this first episode as a live stream, allowing us to answer questions live.

        # Tables

        This is a regular paragraph, which precedes the table.
        When you want to insert a table, indent one level back and specify the plugin.
        Then indent inside again and start writing the table.

    :markdown-it(html plugins=['markdown-it-multimd-table'])
        | This is | the table | header row |
        | ------  | --------- | ---------- |
        | 1       | 2         | 3          |
        | 4       | 5         | 6          |
        [Table 1: Caption goes here.]

        And when you're done, go back to the regular markdown filter.
