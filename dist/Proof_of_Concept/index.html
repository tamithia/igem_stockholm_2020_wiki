The two major parts of S-POP contained in the MFC, is the <em>E.coli</em> biosensor module and the <em>S. oneidensis</em> oscillation module. To demonstrate the feasibility of S-POP as a project weâ€™ve highlighted the successful parts which are vital to the function of the system.</p><p>Sanger sequencing was utilized to show successful insertion of desired gene constructs. To show the expression and activation of the different constructs, fluorescence tags (GFP, mCherry) and Myc-tags were used. The final <em>S. oneidensis</em> oscillation model was developed with the aid of numerical models and simulations. Voltage measurements were used to calculate the current production of the results from the MFC.</p><h1>Biosensor</h1><p>The modular biosensor relies on a promoter region that is upregulated by the presence of specific pollutants. When the pollutant sensing parts are activated, a quorum sensing (QS) molecule, N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) is produced.</p><h2>Successful gene insertion</h2><p>Sanger sequencing was performed to evaluate if the genes of interest had been introduced into <em>E. coli</em>. Sequencing results showed that the vital sensing parts <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3440005">BBa_K3440005</a> (prmA-LuxI-myc tag) and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3440018">BBa_K3440018</a> (constitutive promoter-bphR2 - myc tag - promoter bphR1-LuxI) were successfully inserted. These regions include the pollutant sensing parts (prmA and bphR1/2) as well as the QS-signal producing part (LuxI). <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Results#Cloning">In total 12 constructs were found to have the right alignments</a></p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Results--cloning_6.png" alt="Sequence comparison for construct O (top) and F (bottom)" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 1: Sequence comparison for construct O (top) and F (bottom)</p></div><h2>Gene expression</h2><p>After the successful insertion of the gene fragment, it was essential to test the protein expression. The essential QS-molecule produced by the gene LuxI, under the constitutive promoter, was successfully expressed in <em>E. coli</em> as shown by <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Results#WesternBlot">Western Blot results</a>.</p><h2>Viability</h2><p>To ensure of the <em>E. coli</em> biosensor module viability, tests with the specific pollutant in varying concentrations were performed. These <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Results#Viabilityassays">viability assays</a> started with similar levels to what could be found in the environment, but also higher pollutant concentrations were utilized. <em>E. coli</em> was not severely affected by the pollutants.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Results--fluorescence.png" alt="Growth curves of Top 10 E. coli BL21, constructs F and plasmid 3.2 with PFOS and biphenyls" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 2: Growth curves of Top 10 E. coli BL21, constructs F and plasmid 3.2 with PFOS and biphenyls</p></div><h2>Pollution detection</h2><p>After viability assays showing that <em>E. coli</em> can survive with the chosen pollutants present, the inducibility of the promoters was checked. In tests with similar pollution levels found in the environment and the high levels neither induced the promoters.</p><h1><em>S. oneidensis</em> oscillation</h1><h2><em>E. coli</em> successful gene insertion</h2><p>Shewanella oneidensis requires conjugation or electroporation for optimal gene insertions. The following gene insertions were performed with E. coli as a representative organism. Firstly, the oscillation gene circuit insertion in <em>E. coli</em> was evaluated by Sanger sequencing. The parts, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3440014">BBa_K3440014</a> (Constitutive promoter- LuxR- myc tag-Inducible Promoter Lux-GFP) and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3440012">BBa_K3440012</a> (Constitutive promoter- RhlR- myc tag- inducible Promoter Rhl-GFP) respectively, were successfully inserted in <em>E. coli</em> and characterized. These parts are required for the oscillation to occur, with the exception of the GFP and myc-tag which was used to evaluate protein expression. The protein expression of LuxI, LuxR and RhlI; LuxR and RhlR could be induced by AHL and/or constructs expressing LuxI and RhlI. With these results as and the successful expression of LuxI and RhlI in co-cultures and with no synthetic AHL suggests successful binding to LuxR and RhlR respectively and induction of specific promoters and expression of GFP. The results of this functionality assay are supported by the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Results#WesternBlot">Western blot results</a>, which showed the expression of Myc-tagged Lux, RhlI and LuxR.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Results--WB.png" alt="WB results of constructs" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 3: WB results of constructs</p></div><h2>Modelling / simulations</h2><p>A vital part of S-POP is the <em>S. oneidensis</em> oscillation-system within the microbial fuel cell. Due to complications stemming from COVID-19, we were not able to test the system on the bench. However, we showed success in modelling the system. After running models with generic kinetic values, a representative model was produced. These models evaluate different conditions and simulate applicable variations. The <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Model#SystemofDelayedDifferentialEquations">Model</a> showed that an oscillation can be obtained and can therefore be used to distinguish and identify different pollutants depending on the period of the oscillations.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Model--Osc2_Induced55.png" alt=" Improved inducible oscillatory circuit at induction point T=55" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 4: Improved inducible oscillatory circuit at induction point T=55</p></div><h2>Molecular dynamics</h2><p>One crucial part of the oscillatory system was the protein AiiA, which is a lactonase that degrades AHLs. To determine the affinity of the lactonase, docking was performed using <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Model#MolecularDynamics">molecular dynamics</a>, and the energies used to determine kinetic constants to the different AHLs used.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Model--inthl4.png" alt="HL4-ideal in the binding pocket of AiiA" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 5: HL4-ideal in the binding pocket of AiiA</p></div><h1>MFC</h1><p>The electric output from <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Results#MFC">the microbial fuel cell</a> (MFC) relies on <em>S. oneidensis</em> forming a biofilm on the electrode. MtrB is a vital part of the biofilm attachment as well as the outer membrane electron transport that facilitates the redox reaction which creates the electric output. In the <em>S. oneidensis</em> wild strain MtrB is active and in the <em>S. oneidensis</em> MtrB-knockout is inactivated.</p><h2><em>S. oneidensis</em> wild type</h2><p>When the <em>S. oneidensis</em> wildtype-strain was introduced into the MFC, a biofilm was clearly established. The voltage measurements also indicated steady electric outputs.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Results--MFC_WT2.png" alt="Measurement of current over time in red, with the different phases in cyan" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 6: Measurement of current over time in red, with the different phases in cyan</p></div><h2><em>S. oneidensis</em> MtrB-knockout</h2><p>On the other hand, when the <em>S. oneidensis</em> MtrB-knockout strain was introduced to the MFC under the same conditions as the wildtype, no biofilm was formed. The voltage measurements affirmed that the MtrB-knockout strain has a significantly lower electric output.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Results--MFC_KO.png" alt="Measurement of current over time in cyan" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 7: Measurement of current over time in cyan</p></div><p>The current production by the different strains are illustrated in Figure X These results indicate that when MtrB is inactivated in S. oneidensis, a decrease in voltage can be measured. By utilizing the MtrB-gene, an oscillatory curve can be produced from the activation/repression of the promoter as suggested by the modelling of the system.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Results--MFC_Comparison.png" alt="Comparison between the initial part of the WT current (in red) and the KO current (in blue) over time" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 8: Comparison between the initial part of the WT current (in red) and the KO current (in blue) over time</p></div><p>Current production over time, in MFC with <em>S. oneidensis</em> Wild Type (pink), MtrB KO (light blue)</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The initial plan was that all the separate components would be merged into a functioning system after optimization and characterisation. However, this was not possible due to lack of time. With the foundation built by literature research and laboratory work, a prototype of the modular biosensor could be developed and tested. Even though not all components have been tested, the current findings show promising results.</p><p>In the future, the biosensor module could be modified to detect other compounds as well, after appropriate adjustments of the system. The main challenge in the future will be to optimise the oscillation circuit to perform more accurate measurements of the levels of compounds in the sample.</p></article></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="container"><div class="social_media"><p>Follow iGEM Stockholm on social media</p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/igemstockholm/"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/igemstockholm"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_a6JvWdh6N_i5tYFFcpyw"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/igemstockholm"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/igemstockholm"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i></a><a href="https://igem.se/"><i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i></a><a href="mailto:info@igem.se"><i class="far fa-envelope"></i></a></div><hr><div class="sponsors"><img class="kth" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--kth.png"><img class="ki_innovations" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--ki_innovations.png"><img class="mf" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--mf.png"><img class="snapgene" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--snapgene.png"><img class="neb" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--neb.png"><img class="idt" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--idt.png"><img class="redbull" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--redbull.png"><img class="benchling" src="../assets/img/Sponsors--benchling.png"></div><hr><div class="credits"><p>Sample template built using the iGEM Wiki Starter Pack by BITS Goa.</p><p>Code released under the MIT license.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and themes <a href="https://bootswatch.com/flatly/">Flatly</a> and <a href="https://bootswatch.com/darkly/">Darkly</a> from <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>.</p><p>Some content from the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Example">iGEM Example Wiki</a>.
